# Intake Edit

Android editor for the Pure Love x Violation translation workflow.

Current application version: **0.15.8**.

## Workspace sections

The launcher opens a small workspace home with two sections:

- **Chapter Intake** — the authoritative chapter editor, including stable `H1`/`H2`/paragraph cards, local drafts, SDLXLIFF import, controlled inline markup/endnotes, full-file mode, QA findings/Resolve/Override, and GitHub commit/approval flow.
- **Glossary** — human governance for translation terminology.

## Glossary governance

The Glossary section reads the master glossary state from the configured translation repository.

It supports:

- viewing/searching approved effective glossary entries;
- reviewing agent-generated translation-time suggestions;
- editing a suggestion before deciding;
- approving or rejecting suggestions;
- manually adding glossary entries;
- editing approved entries;
- approving/removing `qa_lock` and case-sensitive lock metadata.

Agent suggestions are stored in `glossary/proposals.json`. Approved additions go to `glossary/approved_additions.json`; edits/lock metadata go to `glossary/governance.json`. Restored Volume 1–5 base glossary files remain under `glossary/full/` in the translation repository.

The agent proposes; the human editor decides what becomes authoritative.

## Chapter workflow and approval

The chapter editor follows four repository-backed states:

- **Pending Review** — editing is still in progress; semantic QA ignores the chapter.
- **Pending QA** — the user used **Tag for QA & Commit** and a fresh semantic QA pass is required.
- **Ready for Approval** — a current reusable semantic QA pass exists with zero active findings.
- **Approved** — the user explicitly approved the exact committed editor content and the repository finalizer produced matching reader XHTML plus a hash-bound approval artifact.

Semantic QA does not itself approve a chapter and does not generate the final reader XHTML. When a chapter is **Ready for Approval**, Intake Edit shows **Approve Chapter**. The app reloads the latest editor document and QA record from GitHub, verifies that the QA pass is reusable with zero active findings, and dispatches PureLove's trusted `finalize-chapter.yml` workflow with the exact editor-content SHA-256 the user approved.

The finalizer performs deterministic XHTML/endnote materialization and repository validation. If the committed editor content changes after the approval request, the finalizer refuses the approval rather than materializing different content.

The configured GitHub token therefore needs **Contents: write** for chapter/glossary commits and **Actions: write** to dispatch chapter approval.

## SDLXLIFF chapter import

SDLXLIFF whole-XHTML imports preserve translatable block order across `h1`, `h2`, and `p` elements. Numbered chapter-title links are excluded from the translatable H1 text so imported headings align with PureLove's `H1-N` locators.

## Chapter draft safety

Chapter edits retain the existing atomic local-draft system. Drafts are restored only when their base GitHub SHA still matches the remote chapter, preventing a stale local draft from silently overwriting a newer remote revision.

## CI artifact

Every push runs unit tests and builds a debug APK. The GitHub Actions artifact is named:

`intake-edit-debug-apk`
